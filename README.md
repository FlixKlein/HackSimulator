v0.0.1 Basic file system completed



v0.0.2 Implementation of JSON storage



v0.0.4 cp command, multithreading, story introduction



v0.0.5 user command, graphical window, application layer setup



v0.0.6 Improved user operations, touch command, improved virtual network structure, ping







The current story is just for testing and demonstration purposes, not the final version.



The bilingual version will be developed after the program's functionality is further improved.
